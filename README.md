# 05-Trivia

Greetings!

In order to get accepted to the elite ranks of Overwatch team you must take the "Overwatch Trivia" test and score more than 7.

You have 100 seconds to complete the test.

If you run out of time, the game will automatically sumbit all answers.

If there are any of the questions that remain unanswered when the time runs out, the game will register those questions as unanswered.

Good luck!
